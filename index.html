  <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Armaud. I currently am a junior in the Computer/Electric Engineering Technology program, going for a Bachelors degree. One of my hobbies are gaming, though I also rarely draw. My reason for choosing my major is because electronic in generals fascinate me, and when I do get to work with them, I always enjoy doing so.</p>
